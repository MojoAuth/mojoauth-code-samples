Engineers at MojoAuth are not limited to developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining the **MojoAuth Platform**. They are also highly motivated to build and learn something new every day. 

As a part of our **Giving Back To Community Initiative**, we aim to share the same with the developers worldwide via our [Blog Portal](https://www.mojoauth.com/blog/).

This repository contains the sample code used in the engineering blogs written for the initiative mentioned above.

<h2 id="mojoauth"> About MojoAuth</h2>

[MojoAuth](https://mojoauth.com/) is the safest passwordless authentication solution that enables your users to login seamlessly with an email OTP or magic link or WebAuthn, which in turn provides stronger security to your business.

First, clone this repository to your desired location in the PC using the following command : 

```ruby

```

The root folder contains the language specific folder for code samples. You can browse to particular directory and access the code sample as per your need

<b>For example</b>

```ruby
cd GoLang

```
This command in the terminal would open the GoLang folder and list all the subfolders. This is where you can find a number of project samples.   

Now, if you want to check with sample how to validate JWT using JWKS in GoLang, please move to that directory :

```ruby
cd  JWTValidationWithJWKS
